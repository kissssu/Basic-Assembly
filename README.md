# Assembly Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of small Assembly programs for various basic tasks. Each program demonstrates fundamental operations such as arithmetic, printing messages, key checking, and table calculations. Below is a brief overview of the contents of each folder:

## Contents

- **Basic-Arithmetic-Operations**: A program for performing basic arithmetic operations.
    - `Arithmetic-Op.asm`: The Assembly source code.
    - `Arithmetic-Op.o`: The compiled object file.
  
- **Hello-World-in-Assembly**: A simple Hello World program written in Assembly.
    - `Hello-World.asm`: The Assembly source code.
    - `Hello-World.o`: The compiled object file.

- **Key-Check-Program**: A program for checking keys pressed on the keyboard.
    - `Key-check.asm`: The Assembly source code.
    - `Key-check.o`: The compiled object file.

- **Name-Greeting-Program**: A program that greets the user by name.
    - `Name-gretting.asm`: The Assembly source code.
    - `Name-gretting.o`: The compiled object file.

- **Table-Calculation**: A program that calculates and displays a table of results.
    - `Table.asm`: The Assembly source code.
    - `Table.o`: The compiled object file.
    - `util.asm`: Utility functions used by the main program.

Each folder contains the corresponding `.asm` file for writing the code, the `.o` object file for compiled output, and a `README.md` with details specific to that program.

Feel free to explore and experiment with these programs!
